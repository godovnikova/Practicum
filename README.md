# Data-Analytics-Projects:

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Yandex Practicum.

Yandex Practicum online data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects .

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recomend you to install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn thest basic libraries.

| Project name  | Sprint name         | Project Description  | Key words  |
| ------------- | -------------       | -------------------- | ---------- |
| 1. Research on the reliability of borrowers - bank data analysis| Preprocessing Data  | Based on the data of the credit department of the bank, he studied the influence of marital status and the number of children for the fact of loan repayment on time. Information was received about data. Identified and processed omissions. Replaced data types with appropriate ones stored data. Removed duplicates. Categorized data. One dataframe decomposed into three.| `financial analysis` `data preprocessing` `Python` `Pandas`|
| 2. Real estate market analysis| Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | Based on the data of the Real Estate service, the market value of various types of real estate objects, typical parameters of apartments, depending on distance from the center. Data preprocessing has been carried out. Added new data. Histograms, boxplots, scatterplots are constructed.| `marketing analysis` `EDA` `Python` `Pandas` `Matplotlib`|
| 3. Analysis of tariffs for a telecom company| Statistical data analysis (SDA) | A preliminary analysis of the use of tariffs on a sample of customers was carried out, the behavior of customers when using the operator's services was analyzed, and optimal sets of services for users were recommended. The data were preprocessed and analyzed. The hypotheses about the difference in the revenue of subscribers of different tariffs and the difference in the revenue of subscribers from different regions were tested.| `product analysis` `marketing analysis` `SDA` `Python` `Pandas` `Matplotlib` `NumPy` `SciPy`|
| 4. Studying the patterns that determine the success of games on different platforms| Preprocessing data, EDA, SDA | Using historical data on sales of computer games, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms, the parameters that determine the success of the game in different regions of the world have been identified. Based on this, a report was prepared for a computer games store to plan advertising campaigns. Data preprocessing and analysis were carried out. The current period for analysis has been selected. Compiled portraits of users in each region. Hypotheses tested: the average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same; the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different. The analysis used Student's t-test for independent samples.| `product analysis` `marketing analysis` `SDA` `Python` `Pandas` `Matplotlib` `NumPy`|
| 5. Analysis of data on investments of venture funds in start-up companies| Data Collection and Storage (Basic SQL) | Working with a database that stores information about venture funds and investments in start-up companies. This database is based on the Startup Investments dataset published on the popular data mining competition platform Kaggle.| `financial analysis` `SQL` `PostgreSQL`|
| 6. Mobile application loss analysis| Business Analytics | Analyzed data from Mobile application. Various metrics were calculated, cohort analysis was used: LTV, CAC, Retention rate, DAU, WAU, MAU, etc. The previously written functions for calculating metrics are used. The correct conclusions are drawn from the data obtained.| `Python` `Pandas` `Matplotlib` `cohort analysis` `unit economy` `product metrics` `Seaborn` |
| 7. Testing hypotheses to increase revenue in an online store - Analyzing the Results of A/B Tests | Making Business Decisions Based on Data | Hypotheses were prioritized by ICE and RICE frameworks. An analysis of the results of the A / B test was carried out, graphs of cumulative revenue, average check, conversion by groups were plotted, and then the statistical significance of differences in conversions and average checks for raw and cleaned data was calculated. Based on the analysis, I decided that it was not advisable to continue the test.| `Python` `Pandas` `Matplotlib` `SciPy` `A/B testing` `statistical hypotheses` |
| 8. Research of the restaurant market in Moscow to make a decision to open a new one | Making Business Decisions Based on Data | I have investigated the question - will a cafe be successful and popular for a long time, in which guests are served by robotic waiters. Based on the results of the analysis, a presentation was prepared for investors with recommendations. In plotting, I used the seaborn and plotly libraries.| `Python` `Pandas` `data visualization` `Plotly` `Seaborn` |
| 9. Analysis of user behavior in a mobile application | Combine project |In this project, I studied the principles of event analytics. I built a sales funnel, explored the path of users to purchase. analyzed A/B test results for the introduction of new fonts. I compared 2 control groups with each other, made sure that the traffic was divided correctly, and then compared with the test group. It is revealed that the new font will not significantly affect user behavior.| `A/B testing` `Python` `Pandas` `Matplotlib` `Seaborn` `event analytics` `product metrics` `Plotly` `tatistical hypothesis testing` `data visualization`|
| 10. [Analysis of user activity Yandex.Zen](Dashboard_Yandex.Zen.pdf) | Automation |Using Yandex.Zen data, I built a dashboard in Tableau with metrics for user interaction with article cards.|   `BI analytics` `Tableau` `product metrics` `building dashboards`|
| 11. Churn Prediction for Fitness Centers | Forecasts and predictions (ML) |This project uses machine learning. The probability of churn (at the level of the next month) for each client was predicted; typical portraits of users: the most striking groups are identified, their main properties are characterized; analyzed the main features that most strongly affect the churn.| `Python` `Pandas` `Scikit-learn` `Matplotlib` `Seaborn` `machine learning` `classification clustering`|
